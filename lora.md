# Lora
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

Lora is a venture focused on the Helium ecosystem. While it's a new venture the people behind have a lot of experience from manufacturing IOT-devices for the consumer sector.

## Company Information (required)

* What is your company name? Lora AB
* How long have you been in business? 6 months
* What kind of products have you created? iOT-devices for the consumer sector
* How many have you sold? 30 000+
* What brought you to Helium etc? To make better and more attractive helium devices.

## Product Information (required)

Your time to shine! What are you building? Whatâ€™s so great about it?
We are building a completely new type of gateway that is more attractive and more reliable.
* First gateway ($350-400)
* Detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts
* Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
* Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
* What is your expected production and delivery timeline?
Photos and videos welcome.

## Previous shipments (required)

Startups welcome! Answer No if that's the answer.
* Have you shipped anything in the past? Yes
* Which countries have you previously shipped regulatory FCC or CE approved products? Yes, to all major EU countries, the US and Canada
* Which countries do you plan to ship to? The nordics, followed by Germany, France, Spain and US

## Customer Support (required)

* How will your customers be able to contact you for support for your products? For the lifespan of the product
* For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements? 24 months after purchase.

## Hardware Security Element (required)

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)

## Hardware Information (required)

Please let us know:
* Which security (swarm) element are you using?
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57)
* We recommend you don't use the SX1301 in new designs
* Where are you sourcing your components from?
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?

## Manufacturing Information (required)

* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before? Yes
* Have you built gateways before? No
* How many gateways did you make? No
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? Yes
This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
* Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital (required)

We intend to produce 10 000 units upfront and after that another 5 000 units per week to keep up with demand.

## Risks & Challenges (required)

The biggest challend for us is manufacturing of SX1303 and availability of Raspberry PI.

We plan to order 40% more than we need, and in that way we think we'll overcome this challenge.

* Payment methods available All major credit cards, and soon HNT
* Regions covered / shipped to - EU countries
